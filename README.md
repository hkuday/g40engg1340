# HKU-Tinder

## Introduction:
The aim of the project is to make a dating program for HKU Students. Such a project, if successful can have its log-in incorporated with the HKU Portal.

## Types of Files:

The Program will majorly have two types of fields:

Key field:These fields will contain the key fields, reponsible for processing queries like sorting, searching and recommended.
Profile fields: These fields are displayed only when another user or the owner themselves want to view the profile.

## Profile fields 

The program contains the following fields under which the user's data shall be stored : username, age, residence/hall, nationality and some physical features.

## Structure:

The program relies on first facing a log in page which then generates a textfile based on their username or asks a new user to log in. Once into their account the user has the option to search for profiles, sort according to certain key fields or ask for recommendations from the program.

## How the recommendation works:

The user is given the option of adding preferences to their profile. Such preferances basically define the basis for how the recommendation system works. According to what preferances the user enters, the program matches it with the database providing the recommended people according to the most matching categories.
